    <h1>Geotag-X</h1>

    <p>Following the PyBossa presentation we'll look at GeoTag-X, built on PyBossa, focused specifically on crowdsourcing information for humanitarian disaster responses.</p>
    <p>First, we'll take you through some GeoTag-X projects to give you a feel for how it works.</p>
    <p>Next, you can have a go at designing your own projects. Or you can help us to improve Geotag-X by developing some of the <a href="https://github.com/geotagx/pybossa/issues">features and enhancements</a> we need, or brainstorm some new features!</p>
