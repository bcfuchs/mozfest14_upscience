    <p>Hey, citizen scientists!</p>

    <p>You don't have to be a professor to make and launch real science projects on the Web. </p>

    <p>New Web-based tools make it a cinch to start high-impact citizen
      science projects without the strictures imposed by traditional  academic research.</p>

    <p>It's called <strong>Upscience</strong>.</p>

    <p>At our workshop, you'll learn about upscience projects  like browser-based
      particle physics games made by students from CERN,
      community-driven crowdsourcing projects to classify images of fracking
      in the US or collect images of drought in Africa, simple browser-based
      approaches to build distributed volunteer supercomputers, and how to
      roll your own low-cost science tools. </p>

    <p>We'll also discuss ways for
      people who are not online at all to participate in upscience.</p>
