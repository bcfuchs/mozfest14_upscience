					 <h1>CrowdCrafting</h1>

<p>Take part in real science projects hosted on the citizen science crowdsourcing platform crowdcrafting.org and  learn about PyBossa, the open source technology behind it, that lets you create your  own 'upscience' projects. </p>

<p>First, we'll give you  a quick tour of  the coolest projects in crowdcrafting.org while we explain the idea behind PyBossa. You'll also get a chance  to contribute to those projects and gather some ideas for what it is to come later.</p>

<p>Next we'll take you through a step-by-step tutorial for creating your own  project in Pybossa.</p>
